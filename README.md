# GameImageUtilScripts
Additional scripts for GameImageUtil, a Call of Duty Image Processor tool. Scobacula or I do not take responsibility for any damages to your machine.

## How to Install
1) Go to the directory where `GameImageUtil.exe` is located
2) Drop the `*.cs_script` file into the data/scripts directory

## USAGE: IW/MW4/MW5/MW6 Material to XCom 2
For this processor script, use it on `xmaterial_*_images.txt` files found within the exported image directory. After a few seconds, you should get `_DIF`, `_MSK`, `_NRM`, `TNT`, and `TN2` files already ready for import into UnrealEd. Setting the output to TGA is required or else it will not import. 

Note: all textures will have an alpha channel from the textures.
